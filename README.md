BZFS Web Server Starter
=======================

This is a simple app to allow you to spin up a web interface which starts BZFlag servers.

**This is not secure!** Do not use this on a public web server. It is for internal use only.

Installation
------------

Download to a web server. Point the server to public_html, not the root directory.

[Download Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) to get the dependencies.


TODO
----

* Allow to kill processes from main page. (Validate that these are actually bzfs processes)
* Parse and auto-update the scores.
